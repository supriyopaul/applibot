**Note**: To fully harness the capabilities of Applibot, particularly the ones that interact with the **GPT-4 model**, you'll need an OpenAI API key that can access GPT-4. As of now, **the GPT-4 access is a premium feature**. Ensure you possess the necessary permissions.

**Steps to Obtain an OpenAI API Key:**

1. **Sign Up on OpenAI**: Navigate to the [OpenAI website](https://openai.com/) and create an account.
2. **Verify Your Account**: Confirm your account through the verification link sent to your email.
3. **Login**: Use your credentials to log in to your OpenAI account.
4. **Access API Section**: Click on your account name at the top right and select "View API keys".
5. **Generate a New Key**: Click "Create new secret key", name it appropriately, and then generate.
6. **Copy & Store Your Key**: Securely copy and store this key; it won't be retrievable again.
7. **Billing Setup**: Ensure you have a payment method associated for any API usage charges.
8. **Set Usage Limits**: Control your expenditure by setting monthly API usage limits.

## Installation

Clone the project and navigate to its directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/supriyopaul/applibot
cd applibot
```

Choose between a virtual environment or Docker for setup:

### Virtual Environment Setup:

1. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python3.9 -m venv ./venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

2. **Install the application**:
    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```

### Docker Setup:

1. **Build the Docker image**:
    ```bash
    docker build -t applibot:latest .
    ```

## Configuration

Set up your configuration file from the provided sample:

1. **Copy the sample configuration file**:
    ```bash
    cp sample-server-config.yaml my-config-file.yaml
    ```

2. **Edit the configuration file**:
    ```bash
    nano my-config-file.yaml
    ```

***Important***: Confirm your OpenAI API key is correctly set:

```bash
$ grep -B 4 "change_this" ./my-config-file.yaml

chat-model:
  model-name: gpt-4-1106-preview
  temperature: 0.0
  key: sk-change_this_default_key
  cache: True

embeddings-model:
  name: OpenAIEmbeddings
  key: sk-change_this_default_key
```

Make sure to replace `change_this_default_key` with your actual API keys.

## DB Setup

Set up a PostgreSQL database for Applibot:

```bash
docker run -itd -e POSTGRES_USER=applibot_user -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=default_password -p 5432:5432 -v ./my-data/postgresql:/var/lib/postgresql/data --name postgresql postgres
```

***Important***: Update the database URL in the configuration file to match your credentials:

```bash
$ grep -B 4 "postgresql" ./sample-server-config.yaml
  pwd-context-depricated: auto
  
table-store:
  postgres:
    url: "postgresql://applibot_user:default_password@localhost/applibot_db"
```

Replace `applibot_user` and `default_password` with your PostgreSQL credentials.

## Run

Launch Applibot:

### For Virtual Environment:

```bash
python -m applibot.server --config my-config-file.yaml
```

### For Docker:

Map your configuration file path correctly:

```bash
docker run \
    -p 9000:9000 \
    -v $(pwd)/my-config-file.yaml:/usr/src/app/my-config-file.yaml \
    -v $(pwd)/my-data/:/usr/src/app/my-data/ \
    applibot:latest
```

### Accessing the API Documentation
When everything goes fine, you should see:

```
Database does not exist, creating...
Database created.
INFO:     Started server process [86118]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:9000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

You can access the API documentation and try out the API using the service host and port specified in your configuration file:

```bash
$ grep -A 4 "service" ./sample-server-config.yaml
service:
  host: 0.0.0.0
  port: 9000
  workers: 1
  data-path: my-data/
```

In this case, the API documentation would be available at: [http://localhost:9000/docs](http://localhost:9000/docs)
